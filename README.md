versioned_dict
______________


Module for a versioned version of Python's dictionaries -
one can retrieve any "past" value that had existed previously
by using the "get" method with an extra "version" parameter -
also, the "version" is an explicit read only attribute
that allows one to know wether a dictionary had  changed.
